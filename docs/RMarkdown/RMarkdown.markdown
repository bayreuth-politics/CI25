 Here you find useful resources and tutorials for both _R_ and _R Markdown_:
 
There are great R Tutorials on [Posit.Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/). Also have a look at their [Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets), which come in very handy. You might be particularly interested in the [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf). This R Markdown [Tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) also is highly recommended!
